The registration page is designed to allow new users to create a new account by providing basic information such as username and password.

## Login

Once the user has successfully registered, they can log in to their account and access their profile. The login page requires the user to enter their email and password.
Data will be stored locally using `MySQL` and `XAMPP`.
